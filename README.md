## Bella Santos and Henry Lemersal
Hey y'all! Here is our legendary game: Period 3 Punchout. Unlike typical fighting games, this one features OUR AWESOME CLASS! Look out for familiar faces, locations, and more. We hope you enjoy :)

## How to Play
To get started, press the space key and you'll be sent to the Character Select Screen. Click through the characters using the left or right arrows and select the two you want to choose for game play! Character 1 uses A and D for left and right movement, W for jump, and Z for punch. Character 2 uses J and L for left and right movement, W for jump, and M for punch. Each character starts with 100 hp of health, but each received punch causes damage and reduces that damaged character's hp. When the hp reaches zero, the game is over and the winner is established. 

### Usage

## Overview
Our classes include Frame class as the GUI, Background, and the Character parent classes. There are Character subclasses that extend Character: Aak, Belluh, HennyBaby, MD, and Vyane. 

## Our Code: Key Methods
### Detail important methods, etc (object creation, paint, score, projectile collisions, game over, select screen, unique features)

## Support and Roadmap
For support, reach out to Bella for graphics, sprite/background paint implementation, damage, and sprite transitions. Reach out to Henry for suppport on Character subclasses, Character selection, game sequencing, and physics movement. We do not plan on actively updating our game in the future, but do think it would be cool to integrate more player options so more people could be included or to create object features such as throws with personalized projectiles for each character.  

(Anything else that could be changed or didn't align with initial goals...)

## Authors & Acknowledgment
All objects, sprites, and backgrounds were created by Bella on PixilArt with inspiration from our class. Thanks to everyone who helped contribute to the success of our game!

## THANK YOU!
